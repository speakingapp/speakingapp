*Read the following IELTS-style questions and answers below and pay attention to the phrases **in bold**. Use the ‘Definitions’ section at the bottom of the page to check the meaning of any phrases you don’t understand.*

**Part 1-style questions**
Examiner: What do you do? Sasha: I **do a job-share** with a friend in a boutique … I enjoy it … I like working with customers … unfortunately it’s only **temporary work** but **one of the perks of the job** is I get a discount on the clothes …

Examiner: Do you have any career plans yet? Carly: Yes … I’d like **to be my own boss** one day … I’m interested in programming and I’d like to create apps for myself or for other companies … I know being **self employed** would be a challenge but the idea of doing **a nine-to-five job** doesn’t appeal to me at all …

Examiner: What do you see yourself doing in 10 years time? Marie: I’d hope to be working … not **a high-powered job** … but I’m quite a creative person so something where I can **work with my hands** would be nice … as long as I’m not **stuck behind a desk** doing something boring in **a dead-end job** I’ll be happy …

Part 2-style task
Describe your ideal job. You should say:

- What this job is
- Whether you would need any qualifications
- Whether it would be easy to find work
and say why you would enjoy this job in particular.

Max: I’ve always loved watching wildlife programmes on TV and often thought how much I’d enjoy working with animals … perhaps in a safari park … something like that … you’d probably need a degree to have any chance of being **called for an interview** and whether there are many **full-time jobs** I don’t know … I’m sure a lot of parks rely on **voluntary work** so it might not be easy … and it probably wouldn’t be **well-paid** either but money isn’t everything … I’d get so much **job satisfaction** … I can’t imagine it being the kind of job where you **get stuck in a rut** … and I think I’d be good at it as well … I’d love to work with animals I enjoy **manual work** and I’m a **good team player** … so even though the **working conditions** might not be the best I think that would be my ideal job …

Part 3-style questions
Examiner: If there are a limited number of jobs available who should be given priority, young people or older people with more experience? Anna: Things are so different these days … a few years ago older employees would often **take early retirement** or go onto **part-time contracts** and there were always opportunities for younger people but now jobs are so scarce … I think younger people need to be given the chance whenever possible …

Examiner: What are some of the important things a candidate should find out before accepting a job? Ali: Well … you’d need to know about your area of responsibility … and your salary of course and then there are things like **holiday entitlement** … **maternity or paternity leave** … if you’re thinking of having children … and what the situation is regarding **sick leave** … that kind of thing …

Examiner: What are the advantages of having your own business rather than working for someone else? Julie: Well … unfortunately being an employee at the moment is very stressful … people have very **heavy workloads** … they’re always under pressure to** meet deadlines** … **running your own business** isn’t easy … but I do think it would be far more satisfying …
