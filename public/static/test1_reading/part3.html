<p class="text-lg font-bold">Q15 <input type="text"  id="ex15" class="border border-blue-500 rounded focus:border-blue-500" required><span id="s15"></span></p>



<p>&nbsp;AS far back as Hippocrates&#8217; time (460-370B.C.), people have tried to understand other people by characterizing them according to personality type or temperament. Hippocrates believed there were four different hos fluids that influenced four basic types of temperament. His work was further developed 500 years later by Galen. These days there are any number of self-assessment tools that relate to the basic descriptions developed hu Galen, although we no longer believe the source to be the types of body fluid that dominate our systems.</p>



<p class="text-lg font-bold">Q16 <input type="text" class="border border-blue-500 rounded focus:border-blue-500" id="ex16" required><span id="s16"></span></p>



<p>&nbsp;The values in self-assessments that help determine personality style. Learning styles, communication styles, conflict-handling styles, or other aspects of individuals is that they help depersonalize conflict in interpersonal relationships. The depersonalization occurs when you realize that others aren&#8217;t trying to be difficult, but they need different or more information than you do. They&#8217;re not intending to be rude: they are so focused on the task they forget about greeting people. They would like to work faster but not at the risk of damaging the relationships needed to get the job done. They understand there is a job to do. But it can only be done right with the appropriate information, which takes time to collect. When used appropriately, understanding communication styles can help resolve conflict on teams. Very rarely are conflicts true personality issues. Usually they are issues of style, information needs, or focus.</p>



<p class="text-lg font-bold">Q17 <input type="text" class="border border-blue-500 rounded focus:border-blue-500"  id="ex17" required><span id="s17"></span></p>



<p>&nbsp;Hippocrates and later Galen determined there were four basic temperaments: sanguine, phlegmatic, melancholic and choleric. These descriptions were developed centuries ago and are still somewhat apt, although you could update the wording. In today&#8217;s world, they translate into the four fairly common communication styles described below:</p>



<p class="text-lg font-bold">Q18 <input type="text" class="border border-blue-500 rounded focus:border-blue-500"  id="ex18" required><span id="s18"></span></p>



<p>&nbsp;The sanguine person would be the expressive or spirited style 0T communication. These people speak in pictures. They invest a lot or emotion and energy in their communication and often speak quickly. Putting their whole body into it. They are easily sidetracked onto a story that may or may not illustrate the point they are trying to make. Because of their enthusiasm, they are great team motivators. They are concerned about people and relationships. Their high levels of energy can come on strong at times and their focus is usually on the bigger picture, which means they sometimes s miss the details or the proper order of things. These people find conflict or differences of opinion invigorating and love to engage in a spirited discussion. They love change and are constantly looking for new and exciting adventures.</p>



<p class="text-lg font-bold">Q19 <input type="text" class="border border-blue-500 rounded focus:border-blue-500"  id="ex19" required><span id="s19"></span></p>



<p>&nbsp;Tile phlegmatic person-cool and persevering &#8211; translates into the technical or systematic communication style. This style of communication is focused on facts and technical details. Phlegmatic people have an orderly methodical way of approaching tasks, and their focus is very much on the task, not on the people, emotions, or concerns that the task may evoke. The focus is also more on the details necessary to accomplish a task. Sometimes the details overwhelm the big picture and focus needs to be brought back to the context of the task. People with this style think the facts should speak for themselves, and they are not as comfortable with conflict. They need time to adapt to change and need to understand both the logic of it and the steps involved.</p>



<p class="text-lg font-bold">Q20 <input type="text" class="border border-blue-500 rounded focus:border-blue-500"  id="ex20" required><span id="s20"></span></p>



<p>&nbsp;Tile melancholic person who is soft hearted and oriented toward doing things for others translates into the considerate or sympathetic communication style. A person with this communication style is focused on people and relationships. They are good listeners and do things for other people-Sometimes to the detriment of getting things done for themselves. They want to solicit everyone&#8217;s opinion and make sure everyone is comfortable with whatever is required to get the job done. At times this focus on others can distract from the task at hand. Because they are so concerned with the needs of others and smoothing over issues, they do not like conflict. They believe that change threatens the status quo and tends to make people feel uneasy, so people with this communication tyle, like phlegmatic people, need time to consider the changes in order to adapt to them.</p>
