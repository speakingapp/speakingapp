<h3><strong>USA: Still looking for Gold</strong></h3>

<p><strong>&nbsp;There are still prospectors searching for gold in the American Far West GOLD</strong> has always attracted people. At the start of the twentieth century. and during the nineteenth century, thousands of men went to the West of the United States, looking for gold. The &#8220;Gold Rush&#8221; lasted, on and off, for sÄ°xty or seventy years, then it finished.</p>



<p>&nbsp;But today, there are still men and women out in the West, looking for gold, as Andrew Rossiter found out.</p>



<p>&nbsp;It was a blistering hot day in summer. The track leading to &#8220;Atlantic City&#8221; (Wyoming) was dry and bumpy, and great clouds of dust blew up behind the car. In 1870, Atlantic City was a prosperous town, with several thousand inhabitants, mostly men. It was a strange place to find a town, mind you, hidden in little gulch in the middle of a wide scrub desert.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Atlantic City began life as a staging post on one of the transcontinental trails, taken by emigrants an route for California. Soon however it became d roaring gold town, where people could make (or lose) their fortunes in a day. Few did make a fortune; many found enough gold to keep them happy but a lot found nothing, or nothing much.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Then, about seven years after the gold rush began, it finished. Suddenly, it seemed that there was no gold left in the ground. The miners packed their tools, their pans, and their bags, and went off somewhere else, to try their luck again. There were no more emigrants either; as soon as the first transcontinental railroad had opened in 1869, the old emigrant trails had been completely abandoned. The hotels closed, the shops closed, the bars closed, the jail closed; and before long, Atlantic City was a ghost town, un inhabited except by the occasional rancher or hunter, and the wandering coyotes. I didn&#8217;t expect to find much in Atlantic City. I knew that a few people lived there again now, some of the old houses had been restored, and others had been built. But l didn&#8217;t expect much.</p>



<p>&nbsp;We drove round a dusty bend, and there in front of us lay the town, a couple of dozen wooden buildings, some old, some new, and mostly pretty plain.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Surprisingly there was a fire-station; then, in the middle of the town, a wooden &#8220;saloon&#8221;. A drink, I thought, something to drink at last.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I stopped the car in a cloud of dust, and we walked up the steps and into the saloon. I saw an old man called Brad. Brad hadn&#8217;t spent all his life digging in tunnels and panning in streams, to find a few ounces of gold. In fact, he was a retired businessman, looking for gold as a hobby, and a nice way to pass the time in a wild, lonely and beautiful part of North America.</p>



<p>&nbsp;More than gold, no doubt, Brad was looking for a way of life, a dream of the past. If he had found no gold, he would not have been too worried. Few of today&#8217;s amateur gold prospectors are there for the money; they&#8217;re there for the fun, the isolation, and the nostalgia!. The legend of the west will go on inspiring people for many many years.</p>
